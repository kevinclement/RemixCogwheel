# Remix Cogwheel

Addon for cogwheel automation in the World of Warcraft Remix: Mists of Pandaria event.

Cogwheels in this event are gems that go into a cogwheel slot in your boots.  You can equip one, and they give you an extra movement abilty like Sprint.  Turns out, when you use the gem it will go on cooldown but it's not shared with other cogwheel gems.  Therefore, you can cast one, take it out of your boots, put in another one, cast it, and so on.  Doing that manually is tedious, so I wrote this addon to automate it.  It presents a single button you can click on that uses the cogwheel and then swaps.
